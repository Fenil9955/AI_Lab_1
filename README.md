Python has a built-in function named calendar which works with date related tasks.
In the program, I imported the calendar module. 
The built-in function month() inside the module takes in the year and the month and displays the calendar for that specific month of the year.
Created two variables named y and m stands for year and month respectively.
User will enter year and month in terminal and output will display the calender.
